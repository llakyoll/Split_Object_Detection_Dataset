# **Splitter Alpha**

Splitter Alpha is a Python application designed to separate datasets into training, validation, and test folders. It allows users to easily select data, specify split ratios, and organize files in designated folders. This application is built with Tkinter, providing a user-friendly GUI for convenient file separation and dataset preparation.

**Goal**

My aim in the project is to complete my object recognition projects completely in my own computer environment and to protect my data.

In the future, I will continue to include features such as data replication in my project and continue to develop this project. If you want to help, you can contact me at the following e-mail address.
